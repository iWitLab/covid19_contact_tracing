# covid19
The code in this project analyzes the responses from the COVID-19 contact tracing app survey which was carried out in Israel on May 2020. The code accompanies the scientific draft of our paper, [How mass surveillance can crowd out installations of COVID-19 contact tracing apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01567). 

The data files can be downloaded from the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/54q9d/?view_only=7c680ad3c1284865a58fffd730ac30d0). 

The code at Covid_contact_tracing_stats.ipynb loads the csv and generates descriptive statsistics and basic graphs. It also contains commented code for creating the factors and feature selection code. 

The .do files include STATA code for logistic regression analysis and for reliability analysis. They require the .dta files to be downloaded locally.
